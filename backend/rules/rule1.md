# On Your Turn

Choose one option:

- **Fortify your Position**
- **Command your Forces**

## Fortifying the Position

If you control more Objectives than your opponent, you may spend your turn **fortifying your position**. If you do so, your opponent loses a number of morale tokens equal to the difference in the number of objectives controlled; your turn then immediately ends.

A player controls an objective if they have one or more units within 2” of the center of the objective. If both players have units within 2” of the center of the marker, the player with more combined models in those units controls the objective. If the model count is tied, no one controls the objective.

There are two kinds of objectives: **field objectives** and **home objectives**.

- *Field objectives* are placed in the central region of the battlefield, and by default belong to no one.
- Each player has a *home objective* in their deployment zone. A player’s home objective differs from a field objective only in that when the model count on a home objective is tied, its home player controls it (*including* when the model count is zero to zero).

## Commanding your Forces

If you choose to **command your forces**, you may command two actions. These actions may be performed by the same unit, or by two different units. Likewise, you may choose two different actions, or the same action twice. The basic actions that may be commanded are:

- **Move**: Move the unit up to its speed value in inches. Movement can be in any direction, including angles and curves, and units may move through other units, provided their bases do not overlap at the end of the move. See [Movement](#movement), below.
- **Skirmish**: If an enemy unit is within range of the unit being commanded, it may **skirmish** with that enemy unit. See [Skirmishing](#skirmishing), below.

> Note: Some units have special actions that only they may perform.

## Overextended

If a single unit is commanded to perform the *same* action twice in a single turn (such as move-move, or skirmish-skirmish), it is considered **overextended** for that second action.

- An overextended unit that moves only uses half its speed value, and triggers **pot shots** from any enemies it is in range of (see [Pot Shots](#pot-shots), below).
- An overextended unit that skirmishes has -1 to all hit rolls and **cover save** rolls (see [Attack Procedure](#attack-procedure), below).
