# On Your Turn

Choose one option:

- **Fortify your Position**
- **Command your Forces**

---

## Fortifying the Position

If you control more Objectives than your opponent, you may spend your turn **fortifying your position**. If you do so, your opponent loses a number of morale tokens equal to the difference in the number of objectives controlled; your turn then immediately ends.

A player controls an objective if they have one or more units within 2” of the center of the objective. If both players have units within 2” of the center of the marker, the player with more combined models in those units controls the objective. If the model count is tied, no one controls the objective.

There are two kinds of objectives: **field objectives** and **home objectives**.

- *Field objectives* are placed in the central region of the battlefield, and by default belong to no one.
- Each player has a *home objective* in their deployment zone. A player’s home objective differs from a field objective only in that when the model count on a home objective is tied, its home player controls it (*including* when the model count is zero to zero).

## Commanding your Forces

If you choose to **command your forces**, you may command two actions. These actions may be performed by the same unit, or by two different units. Likewise, you may choose two different actions, or the same action twice. The basic actions that may be commanded are:

- **Move**: Move the unit up to its speed value in inches. Movement can be in any direction, including angles and curves, and units may move through other units, provided their bases do not overlap at the end of the move. See [Movement](#movement), below.
- **Skirmish**: If an enemy unit is within range of the unit being commanded, it may **skirmish** with that enemy unit. See [Skirmishing](#skirmishing), below.

> Note: Some units have special actions that only they may perform.

---

## Overextended

If a single unit is commanded to perform the *same* action twice in a single turn (such as move-move, or skirmish-skirmish), it is considered **overextended** for that second action.

- An overextended unit that moves only uses half its speed value, and triggers **pot shots** from any enemies it is in range of (see [Pot Shots](#pot-shots), below).
- An overextended unit that skirmishes has -1 to all hit rolls and **cover save** rolls (see [Attack Procedure](#attack-procedure), below).

---

## Pot Shots

In some circumstances, a unit may make a “free” attack against an enemy, known as **pot shots**.

- When making pot shots, the attacking unit rolls a normal attack against the defending unit (see [Attack Procedure](#attack-procedure), below); however, only 6s hit, regardless of the unit’s hit value or other bonuses.
- Calculate damage and casualties as normal.
- Do not commit any morale, do not add any support, and the defender has no opportunity to retreat or counterattack.

**Pot Shot Triggers:**

- Units that move within 1” of an enemy unit trigger pot shots from that unit.
- Overextended units that move within range of an enemy unit also trigger pot shots from that unit.
- A single unit may only make pot shots once per turn, but multiple units may target a single unit with pot shots on one turn if the conditions are met.

---

## Movement

Units commanded to move may move up to their speed value in inches in any direction, making turns and curves as desired.

- They may move over any terrain up to 2” tall freely, counting only horizontal distance.
- Moving up onto any terrain of 2” or more height means that the unit must spend the vertical distance from their total movement, in addition to any horizontal distance covered.
- Units may ignore vertical distance when moving down off terrain, but doing so with terrain 4” or greater in height counts as moving through **dangerous terrain** (see Dangerous Terrain, pg. XX). *Retreating* off terrain of this height always incurs this penalty.

---

## Line of Sight

Line of Sight is used to determine whether an enemy unit can be targeted.

- If an enemy leader is fully visible from the perspective of a unit’s Leader, then it has line of sight.
- If the enemy leader is only partially visible, then the unit has line of sight, but the defending unit receives a +1 cover save in any skirmishes between them.
- If the enemy leader cannot be seen from the unit in question’s perspective, a skirmish may not be initiated.

**Terrain and Line of Sight:**

- If a unit is within 1” of a piece of terrain that partially blocks line of sight, that unit may ignore the terrain for the purposes of its own line of sight, while still receiving a Cover Save bonus against the enemy unit.
- If both units are within 1” of the same terrain piece, both sides are considered to have full line of sight.

**Range Measurement:**

- Measure from base to base of the relevant unit leaders.
- If there is a difference in elevation between the leaders, measure diagonally.
- Melee units may use only the horizontal distance if the vertical distance between the leader is less than 2”. At 2” of vertical distance or greater, melee units measure diagonally like any other unit.

---

## Skirmishing

When a unit initiates a skirmish with an enemy unit, both will have the opportunity to make attacks against one another.

1. **Morale checks** to determine which unit, if any, holds the advantage (see [Committing Morale](#committing-morale), below).
2. **Check ranges**; each unit may only attack if the enemy unit is within range.
3. **Check initiative values**. If one unit has higher initiative than the other, it makes its attack first (see [Attack Procedure](#attack-procedure), below); afterward, if the defending unit still has at least one model, *and* has not retreated after this attack, it may then make its own attack. If both units have the same initiative value, they make their attacks simultaneously.

After this round of attacks has been performed, check for **charges**:

- Melee units that were ineligible to attack due to being out of range may charge after receiving their opponent’s attack (if they still have any models remaining, and did not retreat).
- If the melee unit could make a full move such that the enemy unit is within 1”, it may do so, and then make its own attack. The skirmish then ends.

> Note: Melee units may ignore vertical distances between units of less than 2” when factoring their range. If the vertical distance between them is 2” or more, they must measure diagonally from base to base, as normal.

---

### Skirmish List

1. **Range Check** — units may only attack if the enemy unit is within their range
2. **Morale Check** — determine which unit, if any, has the advantage (see [Committing Morale](#committing-morale), below)
3. **Make Attacks** — units with higher initiative attack first; if the defending unit still has any models left and has not retreated, it may make its own attack afterward. If both sides have the same initiative value, they make their attacks simultaneously (see [Attack Procedure](#attack-procedure))
4. **Charges** — if a melee unit in the skirmish was ineligible to attack due to being out of range, it has the chance to charge. If it could make a move action such that it would be within 1” of the enemy unit, it may do so. It can then make its own attack against that unit.

---

## Committing Morale

When a skirmish is initiated, both players decide, in secret, how many of their available morale tokens they wish to commit to this particular conflict.

- Each player selects a card from their hand of Morale cards which indicates the number of morale tokens they are committing, and places it face down on the table.
- Both players reveal their number simultaneously.
- Each player immediately loses the number of morale tokens they indicated, and returns the card to their hand.

If one player committed more morale than the other, that player may choose one of the following two advantages to apply to their unit for the Skirmish:

1. **Cut Them Down**: This unit receives a +2 bonus to all hit rolls, in addition to any other bonuses (see [Attack Procedure](#attack-procedure), below).
2. **Hold the Line**: This unit receives a +3 bonus to all cover saves, in addition to any other bonuses (see [Attack Procedure](#attack-procedure), below).

In the case of a tie, neither side receives any bonus. A player may not commit so many Morale tokens that they have none left. Players may commit zero morale tokens if they please.

---

## Attack Procedure

To make an Attack:

- A unit rolls dice equal to its number of models times its Strike value, plus any Support (see [Support](#support), below).
- Every die roll that comes up equal to or greater than the unit’s Hit value scores a hit.
- The defending unit rolls **cover saves** — for every hit, the defending unit rolls one die and adds their Cover Save bonus. For every result of 7 or more, discard one hit (Note: if the unit has no Cover Save bonus, this step may be skipped, as rolling a 7 is impossible).

Each hit deals damage equal to the unit’s Damage value to a model in the defending unit. Assign hits to one model at a time until the damage taken by that model is equal to or greater than its Toughness (any extra damage from a particular hit is discarded). Remove that model from play, and continue with the next model until either there are no more hits to assign, or the enemy unit has no more models. A unit’s Leader must always be the last model to be assigned hits.

The defending player then has the option to order a **Retreat**:

- If they do so, they move their unit *exactly* 5” directly away from the attacking unit in a straight line, or as close to a straight line as the terrain will allow.
- They also may remove one point of damage from the last model that was assigned hits. If doing so means that that model has received less damage than its Toughness, then it is returned to play if it had previously been removed.
- A unit that has retreated may not attack, nor charge this turn. Retreating never triggers pot shots.

> Note: Damage does not carry over onto the following turn. A model with 2 Toughness that took 1 damage must still be dealt 2 damage on future turns to kill it.

---

### Attack List

1. **Roll dice** — roll dice equal to the number of models in the unit times the unit’s strike value, plus any Support (see [Support](#support), below); every die result equal to or higher than the attacking unit’s Hit value scores a hit
2. **Cover Saves** — if the defending unit has any cover save bonuses, roll one die per hit received and add the cover save; for each result of 7 or higher, discard one hit
3. **Assign hits/remove models** — Each hit deals damage equal to the unit’s damage value to a model in the defending unit. Assign hits to one model at a time until the damage taken by that model is equal to or greater than its toughness (any extra damage from a particular hit is discarded). Remove that model from play, and continue with the next model until either there are no more hits to assign, or the enemy unit has no more models. A unit’s Leader must always be the last model to be assigned hits.
4. **Order retreat** — The defending player then has the option to order a **retreat**. If they do so, they move their unit *exactly* 5” directly away from the attacking unit in a straight line, or as close to a straight line as the terrain will allow. They also may remove one point of damage from the last model that was assigned hits. If doing so means that that model has received less damage than its toughness, then it is returned to play if it had previously been removed. A unit that has retreated may not attack, nor charge this turn. Retreating never triggers pot shots.

---

## Support

A unit may receive support from a variety of sources. When attacking, a unit rolls additional dice equal to its current support value. Common sources of support are **flanking fire** and **high ground** (see below).

### Flanking Fire

When a unit attacks an enemy unit, it receives +2 support for every friendly unit for which the enemy unit is also in range. Friendly units with a strike value of 2 or more grant +4 support instead.

### High Ground

When a unit attacks an enemy unit, it receives +2 support if its base is one or more inches higher in elevation than the defending unit’s.

## New Rule: Artillery Upgrade — Bombardment

As a commanded action, this unit may place a **bombardment token** anywhere on the battlefield more than 10” from itself.

- This token may be moved by a future bombardment action, but each unit with this ability may control only one bombardment token, and it should be clear which token belongs to which unit.
- If this unit moves, or attacks in a skirmish, or is destroyed, remove its bombardment token from the battlefield (note that this unit may be attacked in a skirmish without losing its bombardment token, so long as it does not retaliate; making pot shots does not remove the bombardment token).

**Bombardment Effects:**

- If any friendly unit attacks an enemy unit that is within 6” of a bombardment token, that friendly unit receives +2 support (if the bombarding unit has a strike value of 2 or more, it grants +4 support instead to the friendly unit).
- If any enemy unit moves while overextended within 6” of this unit’s bombardment token, this unit may take pot shots at that enemy unit.
